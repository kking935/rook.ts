				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
				text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
				of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
				survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
				electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
				popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
				containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
				publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
				Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact
				that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
				page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
				is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
				opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
				like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
				page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
				and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
				in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
				sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
				the like).
